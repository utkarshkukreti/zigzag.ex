# Zigzag

Zigzag is a fast and flexible parallel processing library for Elixir.

It includes a parallel each, a parallel map, and a parallel unordered map
implementation, all supporting a limit of maximum parallel processes to run
concurrently at any given time.

## Installation

Add zigzag to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:zigzag, "~> 0.0.1"}]
end
```
